//Our goal is to create a Chatbot that utilizes cloud infrastructure and visualization services to
//answer FAQ, schedule appointments with physicians, and pay outstanding bills. 
//A chatbot is an automated program that answers questions and completes similar tasks through a 
//text box or through links in order to help move through a website and find the information you 
//need with the help of artificial intelligence. This would be a good way for clients to get their 
//information while keeping the physicians free. For our project, we will be focusing on setting up 
//the project to work for clinics. This document shall give current and future designers the information 
//they require to build, manipulate, and maintain the system as intended.
